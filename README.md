The mark down files can be found in the udpates folder under src.
```
src   
└───updates
│   │   file1.mdx
│   │   file2.mdx
```
The .mdx files should look like this
```sh
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
title: "Example Title"
excerpt: "A small demo of the .mdx file"
url: "https://tattle.co.in/updates"
tags: Demo, Example
---
```
**NOTE** 
- The format should be followed, else an error might occur
- It is important to add the _"day"_ in the date. 
- Currently, tags cannot be written as arrays.
