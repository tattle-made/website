I recently made my [first contribution](https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli/pull/328) to Uli. To get started, I tried setting it up on my local machine last week and spent some time doing so. Despite following the official README, it proved to be more challenging than I anticipated. I overlooked certain steps, and there were additional requirements for Windows that I had to address as well. 

This is a step-by-step guide on setting up "[Uli](https://uli.tattle.co.in/)" locally for development. In this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of setting up Uli on your own local machine, allowing you to dive into its codebase and contribute to its development.

This is the official GitHub repository for Uli - [https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli](https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli)

## What is Uli?
Uli is a browser plugin that de-normalizes the everyday violence that people of marginalized genders experience online in India and provides tools for relief and collective response. It is an attempt to invert the top-down logics of platform moderation and center the experiences of those subject to online gender-based violence. 

The plugin installation link and the user guide can be found here: [https://uli.tattle.co.in/](https://uli.tattle.co.in/)

## Setting Up Uli
Before we begin, let's understand the file structure of the code a bit. All the code for the browser plugin can be found in the `Uli/browser-plugin` folder.
The code is primarily broken into two folders, `plugin` and `api-server`.

| Directory  | Description                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| plugin     | code for browser extension - essentially the frontend        |
| api-server | a rest server for storing user preferences and archived tweets - essentially the backend |

Uli is currently supported on <u>Chrome/Brave and Mozilla Firefox</u> only. The code will work on only these two browsers. 
### Pre-requisites
- npm : v8.3.1^
- nodejs : 16.14.0^
- docker desktop

### Step 1 - Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the `browser-extension` folder.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli.git
cd Uli/browser-extension/
```
Next, install all the necessary packages in the `api-server` and `plugin` folders. 
```sh
cd api-server && npm install
cd ..
cd plugin && npm install
cd ..
```
We've completed step 1 â€“ Uli is cloned, and all the required browser extension libraries are now installed. 

### Step 2 -  Basic Setup
Before starting the development server, you'll need to do a few things, like adding a file and making some changes to another file.
1. Navigate to the `api-server` folder and create a new file called `development.env` with the following content.
Add this content inside the `development.env` file.
```
NODE_ENV=development
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=XXXXXXXXXXX
SERVICE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
SERVICE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXX
DB_HOST: XXXXXXXXXXX
DB_USERNAME: XXXXXXXXXXX
DB_PASSWORD: XXXXXXXXXXX
```
2. **NOTE** - If you are on **Windows**, you will also have to run a command in the `api-server` folder to change the control characters of a file. You will have to change the `entrypoint.sh` file from CRLF to LF by running the following command. 
**Please ignore this step if you are not using Windows**
```sh
dos2unix entrypoint.sh
```
3. Next, navigate to the `plugin` folder and include the following code in the `manifest.json` file. Add this entry to the `connect-src` section within the `content_security_policy` in the `manifest.json` file.
```
http://localhost:3000 ws://localhost
```
Your `content_security_policy` in the `manifest.json` should now look like this. 
```json
    "content_security_policy": {
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'none'; connect-src https://ogbv-plugin.tattle.co.in/ https://uli-media.tattle.co.in/; font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src https://fonts.googleapis.com 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src https://uli-media.tattle.co.in/; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; report-uri 'none';"
    },
```
This process allows you to develop and test your changes on the Chrome browser locally. To enable the same for Firefox, repeat the process in the `manifest.firefox.json` file located inside the `plugin` folder.

I know that was quite a few steps, but believe me, it's smooth sailing from here on. It's all straightforward and simple now.

### Step 3 - Starting the Development Server
1. Now to begin the backend development server for coding, run the following command in the terminal within the `browser-extension` folder. 
```sh
docker-compose up
```
If you get `ERROR: Unknown database 'uli_dev'`, the database was not successfully created and database migration failed. Manually create the `uli_dev` database by logging into `http://localhost:8080/` using the username and password from `Uli/browser-extension/api-server/db/config/config.js` and execute the following.
```sh
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up
```
You should now see database migration in the logs. The `api-server` will be running now.

**NOTE** - For if you are on **Windows**, you might have to start the `api-server`manually. You can do this by running the following command inside the `api-server` docker container. 
**Please ignore this step if you are not using Windows**
```sh
docker exec -it api-server nodemon index.js
```
Or you can also manually access the `api-server` container within Docker Desktop. Inside the container's terminal, run the command `nodemon index.js` after navigating to the `api-server` in Docker Desktop. 

Now, you have successfully started the development server. 

2. Now, to run the plugin development server, navigate to the `plugin` folder.

Run the following command to begin local plugin development. 
```sh
1. For Chrome : npm run dev:chrome
2. For Firefox : npm run dev:firefox
```
If all services run correctly, you should be able to load the plugin from `plugin/dist` folder into Chrome/Brave/Firefox.

**NOTE** - If you are on **Windows**, you will need to make the following changes before running the commands. You'll need to modify the `plugin/package-json` file as described below.
**Please ignore this step if you are not using Windows**
- replace the command `cp` with `copy`
- replace the front slashes in all the file paths to double back slashes

Secondly, running the commands mentioned in the table above will create a `-p` and a `dist` folder every time, which you will need to delete in order to generate a new distribution to reflect major changes.

### Step 4 - Installing the unreleased extension
Once you run the `npm run dev:chrome` command or the `npm run dev:firefox`, a `dist` folder will be created. This folder contains the unreleased extension. Load it in your browser to see the extension in action and develop it further. 

To learn how to install the unreleased extension in your browser, follow the instructions [here](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)

Or, you can follow the instructions below. 
1. For **Chrome/Brave**.
   * Go to `Settings` and then navigate to `Extensions`
   * Next, Enable the `Developer mode` in the Extensions
   * Once that is done, you will see a button labelled `Load Unpacked`
   * Click on the button and load the `plugin/dist` folder. 
   * Uli is all setup in Chrome/Brave. 
2. For **Firefox**
   * Go to `Setup` by executing `about:debugging` in the address bar (where you enter url's and do your web searches)
   * Next, Click on `This Firefox` in the left-hand sidebar. 
   * You will now see a `Temporary Extensions` dropdown. Within it, click on the `Load Temporary Add-on..` button and load **any single file from the dist folder**. This will load the extension into the browser. 
   * To see the extension in action, you will have to open a new tab. 
   * Uli is all setup on Firefox. 

### Step 5 - Cleaning changes
To see significant changes, you'll need to reload the `dist` folder in your browser each time. To start fresh with a new distribution, use this command to delete the `dist` folder. 
```
cd plugin && npm run dev:clean
```
**NOTE** - if you are on **Windows**, you will also have to delete the `-p` folder along with the `dist` folder. 

### Step 6 - We are all done, Uli has been successfully setup locally. 
If you have made it here, hurrayy!! (a big hi-fi)
You've successfully set up Uli on your local machine for development. We're looking forward to seeing the new changes and pull requests you'll be making!
