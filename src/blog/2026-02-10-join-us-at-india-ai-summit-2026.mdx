Over the last year, Tattle has had the opportunity to work closely with the social sector. This helped us understand the safety challenges that arise when integrating AI in their work. The things we learnt about - the knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities will form the basis of the two events we are co-hosting with our partners at the India AI Summit 2026.

If you are interested in joining these discussions, please register at the earliest.

## Session : Why Evaluations Matter: Strengthening AI for the Social Sector

As AI use cases expand in the social sector, strong evaluation systems are essential to protect vulnerable users, improve performance, and ensure positive impact. This event hosted by Tattle Civic Technologies, Project Tech4Dev and The Agency Fund, responds to the urgent need to help development leaders build cost-effective AI evaluation pipelines that maximize benefits and reduce harm. The organizers have pioneered culturally responsive, context-specific methods to make LLMs safer and more reliable for diverse, multilingual communities.

We are joined by the following speakers : Baarish (Tattle Civic Technologies), Vinod Rajasekaran(Project Tech4Dev), Poorva M.(Noora Health) and Vineet Singh(Digital Green)

Event Details : 
- Monday, 16 February 2026 
- 2:30 PM – 3:25 PM 
- Room 14, Bharat Mandapam


## Panel Discussion : Evaluations and Open Source Software for AI for Social Good at Scale
Red teaming in machine learning involves simulating adversarial attacks on AI models to uncover vulnerabilities, biases, and unintended behaviors before deployment. It draws from cybersecurity practices, where "red teams" act as ethical hackers to stress-test systems. It can uncover language gaps, bias and hallucination in LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains like education, food security and public health.

At the AI Impact Summit, HumaneIntelligence and Tattle Civic Technologies will host a panel discussion featuring Ashwani Sharma (Google.org), Sankat Verma (NumFOCUS Board of Directors), Mala Kumar and Tarunima Prabhakar for a conversation on how open source software can lower barriers to red teaming.

Event details:
- Friday, 20 Feb 2026, 1:30 - 2:25 PM IST
- Main event venue - Bharat Mandapam, room 14
- New Delhi, India
