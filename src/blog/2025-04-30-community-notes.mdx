We wanted to better understand what fact check websites are being referenced in community notes on X and their frequency. The data for community notes and user rating can be downloaded officially from [here](https://x.com/i/communitynotes/download-data) and fields of the data have been documented [here](https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/download-data).  The data for notes is available from 28th Jan 2021 to 25th Apr 2025\. The total number of notes in this timeline are approximately 1.85 million. 

We started off by finding what all websites/domains are linked in a note? Using basic regex to extract urls from text and then extracting domain names from the urls, below are the top 20 website domains that are referenced in community notes over time.

We found that **81.23%** of all the community notes had links in them. Majority of the urls linked were from X itself followed by Wikipedia, Youtube, Google, BBC, Reuters, Instagram etc. 

Next, we repeated the same analysis to find the number of community notes which have International Fact-Checking Network ([IFCN](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/)) websites included in them. Since we couldn’t find any available database of IFCN domains, we used the [list from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fact-checking_websites) and manually created an array with the domains.

We would also like to conduct a topic analysis of all notes that include links to IFCN-affiliated websites. The goal is to understand the broader topics, discussions, or contexts in which fact-checking sources are cited. Additionally, we’d like to compare user approval ratings for notes that include IFCN links versus those that don’t.

We then ran a similar analysis as above only for Indian IFCN-afflicated organizations. We found that 10 Indian IFCN domains were present in the **1833** notes, which is approx **0.1%** of all community notes.
