We're excited to announce the launch of our new report, developed in collaboration with the RATI Foundation, exploring one of the most urgent digital safety issues of our time — the rise of AI-generated content and deepfake threats used in online harassment.

Drawing from cases reported to the Trustline, the report reveals a concerning trend: while the public conversation often centers on celebrities and politicians targeted through AI-enabled abuse, a quieter, more personal crisis is unfolding. Ordinary women and gender minorities are increasingly facing threats involving manipulated images and fabricated videos — often at the hands of acquaintances. These cases seldom reach the media, family circles, or law enforcement, owing to deep stigma, fear, and trauma.

Unlike public figures who face harassment in the open and possess some social resilience, many survivors reaching out to the Trustline experience harassment in deeply private spaces. Their struggles underscore the inadequacy of existing protections and the need to rethink how support systems respond to AI-related harassment.

This report aims to humanize these less visible experiences of online abuse and provide new evidence on how emerging technologies are shaping digital vulnerabilities. By centering survivors' experiences, it asks a crucial question: Are our current mechanisms enough to protect and empower the people most affected by AI-driven harm?

We invite everyone—researchers, policymakers, and digital rights advocates—to engage with this report and join the conversation on building safer digital futures.
