title: "TFGBV Policy Dialogue Series by UN Women and SVRI"
excerpt: "We spoke on 'safety by design' at a session that was part of the TFGBV Policy Dialogue Series, co-organized by UN Women and the Sexual Violence Research Initiative(SVRI). Our session focussed on advocating for embedding protective features into digital services from the outset, rather than relying on reactive measures. We shared our experience with Uli on using participatory approaches to bridge resource gaps in NLP technology and how effective use of AI for bridging those gaps."
