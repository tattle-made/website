 excerpt: "Tattle was a part of two panels: 1. AI and Democracy: Battling Disinformation in Asiaâ€™s 2024 Election 2. Safety beyond surveillance: exploring survivor-informed approaches to addressing AI-generated online violence in India. We also spoke about the DAU and how it demonstrates the utility of openness to a space filled with closely guarded processes and black box MLmodels."
