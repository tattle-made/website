 title: "Module on OGBV: School of Campaigners"
 excerpt: "We created an online module as a Knowledge Partner for the School of Campaigners, a joint initiative of Access Polity (NETRI) & Apolitical Foundation, focused on OGBV and its impact on women politicians. We conducted an online session to close the module and invited participants to take part in a crowdsourcing session, and we received slur word contributions in Filipino."
