Tattle is developing the collaboration [platform](https://github.com/tattle-made/dau) powering the DAU WhatsApp tipline. The platform facilitates the triaging, prioritization, and authentication of manipulated media content for escalation to fact-checkers and forensics experts. Users not only have the ability to submit queries but also receive an [assessment report](https://dau.mcaindia.in/all-reports) detailing the extent of manipulation for each media item queried.

You can view more information about the project [here](https://github.com/tattle-made/DAU), check out the open issues [here](https://github.com/tattle-made/DAU/issues), and learn how to contribute [here](https://github.com/tattle-made/DAU/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
